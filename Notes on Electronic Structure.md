# Notes on Electronic Structure

## 1. Overview and Background Topics

### Emergence of quantitative calculation

- Hartree's work
  - Pioneer the self-consistent field method
  - solve the equation numerically for each electron moving in a central potential due to the nucleus and other electrons.
  - heuristic
- Fock's work in 1930
  - the first calculation  using properly antisymmetrized determinant wavefunctions
- Hylleraas' work
  - provide accurate solutions for the ground state of 2-electron systems as early as 1930

> The 1930s witnessed the initial formulations of most of the major theoretical methods for electronic structure of solids still in use today.



- The difficulty in a general solid is to deal accurately with the electrons both near the nucleus and in the smoother bonding regions.
  - **Augmented plane waves**
    - Slater in 1937 and developed in 1950s
    - with different basis sets that are matched at the boundaries.
  - **Orthogonalized Plane waves**
    - Herring in 1940
    - take into account effects of the cores upon valence electrons

### The greatest challenge: electron correlation

- Strong correlations in localized systems and characteristic bonds in molecules.
